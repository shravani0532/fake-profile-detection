# 🕵️‍♀️ Fake Profile Detection using Machine Learning

A Google Colab-based machine learning project that predicts whether a social media profile is real or fake, based on behavioral and account-related features.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project aims to detect **fake social media profiles** using a supervised machine learning approach. It uses various profile metrics (like number of followers, posts, bio presence, etc.) to train a classification model and predict whether a given profile is fake or real.

The notebook is written and run in **Google Colab**.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repo or download the notebook.
2. Open `Fake_Profile_Detection.ipynb` in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
3. Upload your own dataset with profile-related features.
4. Run each cell in order to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate results.

## ⚠️ Dataset Note

The original dataset used for this project is **not available in this repository** due to storage loss.  
However, you can use any dataset with features such as:

- Number of followers/followings  
- Post count  
- Bio presence or completeness  
- Account verification  
- Profile age  
- Engagement metrics

Example datasets can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) by searching for “fake social media profiles”.
